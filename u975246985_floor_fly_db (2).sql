(9, 1, 'The Best Way to Invest In Real Estate', '<p>The ever-growing cosmopolitan Dhaka is in high demand in creating living space. Living luxury has become a compulsion when it comes to living in Dhaka and when it comes to investment, everyone has their perspective about it. The phenomenon is making money out of an investment in the real estate sector. The world is getting older and the livable space has shortened over the epochs, but none of us has realized that one day the audacity of consuming livable space of other species shall become a suicidal mission by humans and the wrath of Mother Nature shall be upon us. Time to think about where to invest and how to invest</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Builders</strong> and Construction firms are shaping our cities and they are one of the key master planners for iconic structures. But a city&rsquo;s future does not always rely upon the skyscrapers or iconic structures, it is about usability, making lifestyle easier and convenient for its inhabitants. If we compare Australia and China where I visited very frequently over the last two decades, the difference is very visible. The way Australia planned and shaped their cities or the cosmopolitan areas, is now outdated due to the growing demands where the buildings are mostly two-storied or a suburban area is full of townhouses. China is unlikely in another way around, it planned for the growing demand for livable space in the cities and their policy was to make every family an owner of a flat. So now the Chinese people are not renting and they have their property. That&rsquo;s how the Chinese govt. is utilizing its resources and creates synergy in the economy. In Dhaka city whatever the areas are like Uttara, Bashundhara, Baridhara, Mirpur, Banani, Mohammadpur, Khilgaon, or at Diabari, you will find more than 90% of population is migrated from different parts of Bangladesh and they rent their living place. It is not that they cannot effort a home or they don&rsquo;t belong to the area, rather it is because they have no option without renting as the developer companies are unable to offer them according to their need. The developers are always partaking in wishful discerning of the elite or semi-elite class. So the middle class and lower middle class is being always denied. Floorfly is to change the paradigm and wish to bring changes for believing its motto &ldquo;every life deserves a living space&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where to invest if there is no supply according to demand? Every innovation is dealt with troubles and the question has its answer. But finding the right place to invest may become very ambiguous and life-threatening if it is not taken seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nowadays</strong> there are groups who get bunched up together and purchase a piece of land and they together wish to build a structure and often it is called shared development. Should you invest in here just to live? Are you aware of its outcome and future or are you sure that you will get what you wanted? Who to blame if something goes wrong? Who is among you shall be held responsible? Why and by what laws the person shall abide by the group? Who to check quality or how to manage the very detail of micromanagement of erecting a building? There are hundreds of questions and confusion when it comes to shared developments by so-called shareholders or inviters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When</strong> it comes to the terms of investing, it means an achievement where you need to ensure maximum ROI. You have to be visionary or to counsel the experts to make a secure investment in the real estate sector. Look out for the <a href=\"https://rajuk.portal.gov.bd/site/page/68c8d4af-f493-43de-a54c-b0dc83d56bff\">DAP</a> (Detail Area Planning) of <a href=\"http://www.rajuk.gov.bd\">RAJUK</a>, City Planning, connect with people who are engaged in city designing may give you a clear picture in which area you should invest either for living or to maximize your ROI. Look out for that particular area&rsquo;s land value, find it out whether it is a leasehold property or a privately held property. Leasehold properties always pay more in the future than privately held properties. Have your own gut&rsquo;s feeling, talk to your Sales Agent who is known to you for years. After considering all the facts involved then decide where to invest. The already grown up populated area will miss its beauty in 4-5 year time because of its old perspective view. Modern architecture&nbsp;shall be implied in the new areas and more innovation shall be practiced in the developing areas. Diabari in Uttara, Tongi in Gazipur, and Basila in Mohammadpur could be your next destination for either investment or living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before investing in the Real-Estate one must consider the top ten factors which matter the most:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Background of the company or the person from whom you intends to buy</li>\r\n	<li>Achievement history</li>\r\n	<li>The <a href=\"https://floorfly.com/details/land-registration/1\">property registration</a> process and history</li>\r\n	<li>Rajuk approved FAR (Floor Area Ratio) wise carpet area</li>\r\n	<li>Know how much space is taken as a common area (in most of the cases corruption begins here)</li>\r\n	<li>Handover time and related clauses in the Sales Deed (this is the most tricky part)</li>\r\n	<li>You are not buying a piece of cloth, so you must meet the owner of the company or the person whom you are purchasing the property</li>\r\n	<li>You must know who is signing the Sales Deed if it is other than a person and on behalf of a company; ask them to show the &ldquo;Board of Resolution&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>Have a clear understanding of the area and its potential</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure you get professional advice before purchasing your property</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank You dear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'the-best-way-to-invest-in-real-estate', '/public/upload/blogs/1609828932land.png', '7', 1, '2020-12-30 10:11:35', '2021-01-06 11:42:59', '', '', '', 1),
(28, 1, 'Why this is the right time to invest in property', '<p>According to the <a href=\"https://rajuk.portal.gov.bd/site/page/68c8d4af-f493-43de-a54c-b0dc83d56bff\">DAP</a> (Detail Area Plan) of Dhaka city, only 7% of the 1528 square kilometers are reserved for residential and commercial use. It is mentioned here that 2% of the space is allocated for commercial use. This confirms the scarcity of land usage for either living or for commercial use. We know that if the demand versus supply is low, it is deliberately called scarcity and as a result, the price of property never went down but going up at a geometric rate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every human has the first dream of his own property. About 80% of the people in Dhaka do not own property. Every year about 1 million new people come to Dhaka city to live permanently in need of work. If this rate continues like this, there will come a time when we may not be able to ensure any kind of property for all due to our scarcity of land.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to Corona, most of our essentials are closed in most of the countries and for the same reason, we are facing some difficulties in importing goods. Hopefully, within this year, the incidence of corona will come down and with it, inflation will start all over the world. Demand will outpace and there will be a huge gap in supply and demand due to the inability to produce in line with the demand, which will increase the value of our essentials in an unusual way and will have an impact on the value of the property. And the idea is that this price could increase from Tk 5000 to Tk 10,000 per square foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a saying in our country that &quot;if anyone can&#39;t make a profit by buying, he/she can&#39;t make a profit by selling&quot;. Now is the time to buy and make a profit. One of the main reasons for not investing in property is not being able to liquidate quickly. But in my opinion, this idea is not true. If the location of a property is good, if the reputation of the company is good like CDL then it is very easy to sell the property with profit. Secondly, in these types of well-documented properties which are free from any ambiguities, any financial institution offers financial benefits within a very short processing time and people can get up to 90% financing of the total property value. There are many benefits to investing in real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Own living and secures future even for the next generation.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is for investment, monthly handsome rental income is assured.&nbsp;<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Price always appreciates.&nbsp;<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Being in the running process makes it easy to sell.<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Financial assistance is available from financial institutions.&nbsp;<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The <a href=\"https://floorfly.com/details/property-maintenance-cleaning/18\">maintenance</a> cost of a commercial property is very small.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I can say that those who invest in property right now will benefit financially more than ever.

(29, 1, 'Cheapest Flats During Coronavirus Pandemic', '<p>What happened to Dhaka City during this coronavirus pandemic? Why there are so many to-let signs flopping on the streets? Why people left Dhaka city? How the economy of Dhaka unambiguously got affected? Why footfalls in the super-shops, malls, street markets have fallen behind their target?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody will say one simple thing; oh it is for Coronavirus! Compared to the fatality rate of cancer, hepatitis B, or even influenza, coronavirus is inferior in taking lives. The answer could be justified after cramming our socio-economic culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strength of our socio-economic structure relies upon the garment sector, agriculture, and housing. The whole financial sector is heavily dependent on these three key industries. When the pandemic spread out in early January 2020, the largest buyers of our garment industry had either stopped or held their orders and as a result, 72% of our garment workers either lost their jobs or being sent home for leave without pay. 22% of Dhaka city&rsquo;s FMCG products are consumed by these garment workers and 27% of Dhaka&rsquo;s population is somehow related to the garment industry. On the other hand, there was a big pause in the construction work and the whole industry was shut down temporarily for around five months. Of course, there are exceptions, but exceptions are not meant to be examples all the time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the consumable agricultural products were produced but people lost their purchase capacity. In Dhaka city alone the food price had a price hike which shored up to 50%. Other than Dhaka city the food price was precisely low and the whole supply chain took the most severe hit. People couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore who had financial support from their hometown for living in Dhaka. All large multinationals and local companies lost their revenues and they sent their employees on leave for the long term and they fired people. The vacuum started creating in the urban area and gradually the cosmopolitan area took the hit afterwards. At one point it seemed nothing will roll back to its previous state. We will never get back into our previous life.&nbsp;<br />\r\nBefore the Coronavirus hit us, the lifestyle of living people in Dhaka was different. The spending habit didn&rsquo;t instill us for hoards or making investments. Lower-income groups to upper-middle-class people used to rent homes from three thousand taka to forty thousand taka and they had a very little amount to survive without income for consecutive three months altogether. So what happened is, people had to leave Dhaka. Now anyone may think of what happened if these people never had to leave the city; the city&rsquo;s economy would be rolled if not in full swing. This could have taken only 12 year&rsquo;s rent to own the rental property. But our banking system is not supportive or workable for the lower-income to the middle-income group. And even if it were so, there was nothing like a construction or developer firm who could build such a living place. Not even 1% of the entire real estate is offering 700-800 sft flats which could be the best solution for few target groups.<br />\r\nAt Diabari in Uttara, there is a condominium project where the entire design is created for 4 target groups. People who want luxury with 2100sft or people who want to spend their whole life in a tiny but spacious 750sft, are offered a society equipped with lots of greenery and open air. The price is very much affordable compared to the cost of construction and land value. The condo is situated in the heart of Uttara and the main HUB of the Metro Rail. Working people could conveniently maintain their time for the office, could save lots of money and time.<br />\r\nDhaka is not apart from global urbanization. As a part, the city&rsquo;s skyline is getting richer in color and architectural aspects. Modern buildings are erected at a higher pace than compared to Mumbai or Bengaluru. But the most important part is whether the living quality is improved. A true cheap condo could be the easiest and only solution to the question. We are always in a dilemma when it comes to the point of purchasing a property especially when it is 3 to 4 years long term planning. We need to decide according to our needs and purchasing capacity. The Diabari Condo could be a perfect match for young and middle-aged people who wants to own a flat in the heart of Dhaka.&nbsp;</p>', 'cheapest-flats-during-coronavirus-pandemic', 'public/upload/blogs/1610021459land12.png', '9', 1, '2021-01-07 18:11:00', '2021-01-19 11:01:59', NULL, NULL, 'public/upload/blogs/1610021459profile.jpg', 1),

(43, 1, 'The Dilemma of Decision Making', '<p>Decision is like ice-cream; you need to be quick and fast and else it will be a wastage. This wastage could be sometimes life-threatening, sometimes a loss of opportunity. The question is how this dilemma affecting our decision-making process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an event comes into our mind like purchasing a flat or a plot few elements in the path of our decision-making process put a barrier. Fear, uncertainty, outcome, internal and external influences commonly the closed ones like friends and family, lack of knowledge, etc. are the most common elements. Our brain gives us a negative signal when purchasing something big in the course of a decision. Our brain puts us into a dilemma. Let&rsquo;s say we are on a highway driving a car at 90kmph speed and heading for a destination. All of a sudden a bus from the opposite direction overtakes another vehicle and you have no time to make your decision using your computers or asking for friends; you need to decide in milliseconds. What you would do? You either decided to put your two feet on the brake paddle or you decided to drive through on the very edge of the road. Now it is a question of survival. People make mistakes or make the right decision on glimpse. Most of the road accident occurs due to driver&rsquo;s indecision and dilemma to take a precise decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how people are making the right decision at the right time? The simplest answer is intuition and vision. When making any decision you have to depend on these two elements heavily. Intuition is sometimes diluted with fear and anxiety. So, it doesn&rsquo;t work all the time, but vision works all the time. If you are visionary you can certainly make decisions in just 1-3 minutes. And this time is ideal and appropriate for everybody including individuals and businesses. The other factors for making the right decision are knowledge, a survey, and an exit plan. Knowing an area, its future can determine your investment making decision. If you had done your survey before taking a decision it could add extra value and give you a clear vision of the property&rsquo;s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a question of whether you should invest in an ongoing project or a ready project; whether you should invest in Gulshan or Purbachol. Even after these, your decision might turn out wrong. So, you need to have an exit plan. Let&rsquo;s say you have bought an apartment in Gulshan for BDT 16,000 per square foot and that apartment appeared to be the worst nightmare for you, what you could do? You could have sold it or rented it out. Generally selling any properties especially apartments could be down turning in terms of ROI unless it is meant for living. So before making any decision it is deemed necessary to have an exit plan.<br />\r\nFloorfly ensures your maximum ROI, an updated market survey in regards to the property, and can provide you a better exit plan.</p>', 'the-dilemma-of-decision-making', 'public/upload/blogs/1612354897DILEMMA_FLOORFLY_KMA.jpg', '11', 1, '2021-02-03 18:21:37', '2021-02-03 18:21:44', 'Kazi Manzur Ahmed', 'CEO Floorfly Realtor Ltd', 'public/site_assets/img/kazi-manzur.jpg', 1),
(44, 1, 'A-Z of Real Estate Marketing (Part 1)', '<p><strong>Paradigm of Real Estate</strong> marketing is often mistaken and sometimes mixed with other industries by the marketers. If we look into the examples carried out by other marketers around the world, the mistakes are visibly clear but not understood well. When Covid-19 affected our real estate community back in February 2020 we all put ourselves into a concrete summary that the <strong>property price</strong> will go down. In this case the marketers did not play any thriving role. As a result it took time for the Real Estate Industry of Bangladesh to change its shift of people&rsquo;s mindset. The marketers engaged in digital marketing and to all of us the term of digital marketing stands only for Facebook. They kept posting their ads into the social media and THAT&rsquo;S IT. So what could have done by the Marketing Managers/CCO/CMO of the Real Estate companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As a whole</strong> marketing is meant for promotion, a term for communicating with the target market and audience. Real Estate marketers are not the best of the country&rsquo;s marketers or they are sometimes dominated to establish few agendas by the owners. On the other hand the marketers are tend to be stubborn not to adopt with modern technologies. If we are taking Facebook for one and only digital tool, even that could be enough if done in a right way. We are not just profound of changing shifts of Facebook. Over the last 8 months Facebook changed its ad set options, cpanel and algorithm 18 times. But, we did not adopt ourselves to the change. We only know carousal ads, lead generation process. Let me ask you a question. When you search anything in Google, Yahoo or Bing, you might experience an ad popping up on top of your Facebook wall when you are in active mood. How that works? It is because of the pixel and look-a-like audience. The algorithm works better according to your pixel and website settings, which means digital marketing does not mean only Facebook, rather it is your own Website, SEO, Remarketing tools and obviously for wide range the other social medias. Let&rsquo;s say we have done that all, and is that enough? The neutral answer is <strong>NO</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Email marketing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Whatsapp business?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LinkedIn marketing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Instagram marketing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SMS marketing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you done it all? YES! But still not getting my desired output. OFCOURSE, it is because you are not a professional. Either you need a professional team or a Professional agency. FMCG marketing is way easier than Real Estate marketing as the target market is much wider and demography coverage is massive. Real Estate marketing is more like target marketing.

In this part, we will try to understand how it is different than the other marketing strategy or communication and how it should be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Estate as a whole is very niche segmented and the audience of targeting is very narrow. There are 1.8 million flats are built in Dhaka city alone over the last two decades. And that means it covered almost 10% of the inhabitants of the city who are owning the flats. Three years back I came across a headline of a very reputed newspaper which said there were overly supplied flats in Dhaka which are awaiting to be sold. The writer did not have any accumulated knowledge and whatsoever about the housing system in Bangladesh. Now if someone expects that flats will be sold like any FMCG product is wrong. There are always shift changes in house ownership like other assets. Simply think of the Kingfisher House owned by Vijay Mallya the chairman of the Kingfisher group, the ownership transferred to another person. In every 20 years and so you can assume that there will be a shift change of housing due to few reasons like age, income, economic and political influences. So that&rsquo;s has happened back in 2018. The housing sector feared not selling their properties. Now few superstitious people may say that due to luck or due to price the market took a pick. But it was never the price rather a precise shift change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the marketers of the real estate industry could not pinpoint their target market and they were shooting all of their missiles at one single point. They became oblivious about their new target area, new age, a new profession. Because of technology, there have been so many new companies, new developments, and the economy in the banking sector changed at least for the next 10 years. Technology and new leadership have taken the old&rsquo;s place and the targeting of the audience is even more thinner. A single e-commerce platform can either replace or shrank to the brink of income of thousands of retail vendors. For massive digital media the sign-board, bill-board advertising, print media advertising has gone down and many people have lost their jobs over the last 5 years. Adopting technology is another issue which we will discuss in another blog post of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.floorfly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">floorfly</a>. Now we may understand how and why it is narrow than FMCG marketing. It is a tough job indeed. But every job can be accomplished if done wisely and smartly. So for Real Estate marketing we need to think and we need to find out how to find these investors and how to target them, we need to think about how they think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we sum up the targeting, we may find three groups for property buyers such as</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

The root of the transfer of ownership of any land is a must finding facts before purchasing and developing land. The issue is not understood by many flat buyers as they are diverted through the eye-catching advertisement by the companies. Floorfly selected plots and lands are carefully evaluated before approaching the desired buyers. Floorfly has number of legal specialists who work relentlessly on the issue. So every purchaser is assured about the authenticity of the products showcased by Floorfly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floorfly is offering more choices in regards to choosing a property with a competitive market analysis, which means people can be assured of a winning environment where both the buyer and seller of flats or apartments are benefitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the deciding factors in the path of apartment purchasing are price, size, facilities, amenities, facing, and payment schedule, one must be concerned with the most important part which is the original Rajuk approved plan, Land ownership, Mutation (City Jarip), and DAP (Detail Area Plan) clearance. Floorfly is well concerned about these facts and ensuring the rights of a buyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Operating Area of Floorfly</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floorfly is currently operating in Dhaka city of Bangladesh with a registered office and a Head Quarter and two branch offices.

Property Portal of Bangladesh</a>&nbsp;keeps the record under the &ldquo;SOLD&rdquo; tag so that any person can see and compare the price and can get a hint about negotiation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If for any reason, Floorfly finds ambiguous activities by the seller of any flat, apartment, or plot, Floorfly removes the property from the listing, hence avoiding bad experience in the real estate sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'frequently-ask-questions-about-floorfly', 'public/upload/blogs/1613380137FF-FAQ.jpg', '8', 1, '2021-02-15 15:08:57', '2021-02-15 15:10:39', NULL, NULL, 'public/site_assets/img/kazi-manzur.jpg', 1);

We design what they don&rsquo;t expect, what they would never have imagined. We approach creative thinking with the mind of a child, without limits, except for those we have verified through experience. All alternatives are worth consideration and in this way we often make some very interesting discoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>DETAILS</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for a person to perceive space and understand it, he or she must open to a myriad of stimuli and information that is then filtered through his or her own cultural awareness. Detail comes from the basic elements of this inner &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>IRONY</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We know from experience that one definite and univocal solution will never satisfy what is needed to create something unforgettable. That&rsquo;s why we like weightlessness; in architecture it is synonymous of openness and diversity. Providing different interpretations for one object or place means favouring thought, imagination and the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>AMBIANCE</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural space becomes real when an idea is &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; by the ambiance for which the project is being developed.

(23, 'Land Registration', 'land-registration', '<p>When buying land, it is very important to know how to measure the size of the land and to have the correct knowledge about the land documents. If you are thinking of buying a piece of land without understanding these issues, it can be a very complicated and wrong decision. There are many things to consider when buying land and the role of legal issues is very important. When land is sold, the buyer or their representative is officially registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if there is a problem with the land documents, it is absolutely impossible to implement it. Floorfly.com gives you a flow chart below to illustrate the process so that you can easily figure out what steps to follow to register land in your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://floorfly.com/upload/services/land-registration.jpg\" style=\"height:500px; width:678px\" />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Before purchasing land, check the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Verify that the seller has proper ownership of the property and has a legitimate right to sell the property.</li>\r\n	<li>Check whether the last deed of the property is in the owner&rsquo;s own name or if the property is inherited. Because under Section 53C of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, if a person owns property in a manner other than inheritance, under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950, if he does not have the latest ledger in his own name, or if he is the owner of the property by inheritance, if he has not prepared the last mutation in his own name, he cannot sell any property, if sold in any other way, it is a punishable act.</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the land tax (khajna) has been paid till now. If the land tax (rent) has already been paid, go to the office of the concerned Assistant Land Development Officer and check whether the receipt or receipt of payment of land development tax (khajna) is authentic.</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the seller has possession of the proposed property. It would not be right to purchase the land without the seller&#39;s possession of the property.</li>\r\n	<li>Check whether the property is owned by the govt. Buying or selling the government is a punishable offense.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Land Measurement<br />\r\nFirst, find out the length and width of the land. If the size of the four sides of the land is not equal, find the average of the length and width. Then divide the multiplication of the width and length by 435.6. The result is the accurate measurement of the land in decimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://floorfly.com/upload/services/land.jpg\" style=\"height:849px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floorfly.com provides a smooth Land registration through its own legal and govt. registered vetting process.
